## Context:

Worked with Principal Investigators from Stanford's Public Health Care and Social Good Dept. Researched and Designed novel metrics for Ethics and Fairness in Gender Based Violence, analysed downfalls of Risk Assessment Instruments in legal system; Retrospective and Qualitative analysis of a womenâ€™s helpline using AI-NLP; Contextual Inquires with helpline users to understand choices and needs.

During this work, I also conducted thought experiments, gathering a woman's perspective on safety and privacy, and helped better understand the parameters which, in hindsight, drive your decision making in a social context. This was a study I performed to better understand the Ethics and Fairness in Gender Based Violence.
