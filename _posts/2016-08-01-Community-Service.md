# My experience as a volunteer at National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights

I have been involved with the NCDHR, an NGO, which works towards eliminating the discrimination based on caste. I volunteered for the teaching team for one and a half months. I taught primary and secondary school kids (from slums, primarily) the basic mathematics and computers. During this period, I was exposed to a whole new world, culture and perspectives.

In Seelampur slum, we went from doors to doors, talked with girls and their mothers, encouraged them to send their girls to our classrooms and be a part of our movement. And, I can tell you, around **45% of the women** responded literally like this, 

_“I wish a better life for her. I wish my girl to be educated, self-sufficient and stand up for herself. I don’t want her to end up like me.”_

And, bingo! We could get in the first **25 girls** into our program.

So, all we did was to **create a space**. We created a **safe environment for those girls to learn, experiment, fail, and try again**. We taught them **mathematics, logic, computers, and fundamental communication skills**.

**Positivity is contagious**. All it took me to make this program a success was **thoughtfulness** with a twist of trust. Everytime a student came up to me with her doubts or confusions, this is how our conversation used to go like:
		
“Didi, I have been trying to solve this math-homework problem since last night. I just can’t seem to get it,” she said confusedly.

“Okay, let’s try it together then.”
	
We discussed the problem and she got hold of the concept.

Still doubtful, she added, “I knew this was a very basic question, nothing twisted, I wonder how was I not able to solve it? All the other girls did it without any hint. I sometimes feel that I lack the brain to understand mathematics fully. I feel, there’s no point into spending time into something which I anyway won’t be excelling in.”

“Well, I think I got the main problem here.”

“And what is it?” her curious self asked.

“Self-doubt. And, the moment you throw this parasite away, you’ll do great. Trust me.”

“Really?”
		
“Yes Fatima, you can very well do it. Sometimes, it’s okay to fail. It happens to everybody, has happened to me innumerable times. But, you gotta keep going. It’s no rocket science, and you’re perfectly capable to understand such concepts. And, I believe in you, I know you’ll be good.”

“You really think so, didi?”

“I know so,” I assured her.
	
And, it used to work like magic. Their energy levels and output actually shot up.

When I sat and talked to those girls, **I could see potential, intelligence, passion, commitment, focus, and possibly, the great leaders of future. It just needed someone to unlock these****.

It’s not enough to say that our India is a multicultural and multilingual country which has produced great mathematicians, artists, revolutionaries, and CEO’s, when our girls are totally out there, tethered, and no hope, or seemingly no hope. If we really wish to change the world around, **we need to be brave enough to care**. Above all, care for those who go unnoticed.

**One step, one act of help and kindness is all it takes. Believe me**.
