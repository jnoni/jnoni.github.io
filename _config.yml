    authors: Indifference is more dangerous than anger and hatred", Elie Wiesel, a Noble laureate.
    location: Our indifference to an animal’s pain, a being that is habituated different from us, says an awful lot about our species. The movement for animal liberation is an ask for extending our most basic human decency to animals. In his 1975 account, "Animal Liberation, A New Ethics" for Our Treatment of Animals, Singer makes an appeal against speciesism, thus marking a historic shift in our perception of morality and its boundaries that too often fail to expand beyond homo sapiens, the 'cognitively superior' being. This founding philosophical work by Peter Singer put the discourse on animal ethics on the global map.
