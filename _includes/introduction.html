<!--   I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at <a href='https://inklab.usc.edu/'>INK Lab</a>, USC. My research interests lie in applying deep learning and reinforcement learning to solve NLP problems. More specifically, I am highly interested in the analysis and application of the concepts of interpretability and explainability in deep models. You can view my work on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YuRzzf0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a> and <a href='https://github.com/SahanaRamnath'>Github</a>.  <br><br> 
  
  Prior to this, I worked as a Predoctoral Researcher at <a href='https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/'>Google Research, India</a> for two years. I graduated with a dual degree (MTech in Data Science and BTech in Electrical Engineering) from the <a href='https://www.iitm.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>, India in 2020. <br><br>

I finished my BTech and MTech from IIIT Delhi, India. In 2023, I parted ways from corporate life. Currently, I'm a CS PhD student at IGDTUW, advised by Dr. Devendra Tayal. My research interests lie in efficient AI governance and policy research. I like to identify problem statements centered around convoluted socio-economic challenges of backward Indian communities and building computational solutions. Which, inevitably, calls for better policies, legal intervention, and ethics protocols - exactly the intersection I’m interested in. Face image detection algorithms are discriminatory against non-caucasian racial groups such as those from Islamic faiths, African, South Asian, Latin descents. There’s always been a lack of Science in legal systems across the world.<br><br>

I believe my education has been a tool for realizing my passion for criminal justice reform. I dream to pursue a road less taken in the field of Computer Science research by bringing my ideas and perspectives to the cause of legal literacy, civil rights, judicial policy, wrongful incarcerations, and ensuring risk assessments instruments used in criminal trials are rooted in fair and equitable technology. Some of this I studied during my undergrad; now I want to formally work on such threads in my PhD. I envision myself getting a formal law degree somewhere down the line and use it to better the tech and vice versa; so if you're a law or interdisciplinary research student, I'd love to chat with you.<br><br>

I created this digital shindig reluctantly because I was unable to fill out some important career postings without a placeholder website. This site is my thought dump, a filing cabinet, not a LinkedIn. If you are looking for my detailed professional chronology and past work, jump right <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupal-jain-677301125/">here.</a> <br><br>

I volunteer my time to help trauma survivors make a living for themselves and underserved tech students grab important positions at coveted places in the world. I offer to write résumé, grant applications, scholarship letters, research proposals, strategic interview preparation, community management or building one from ground up, help managers invest in belief capital, and such. During college, I nurtured a women-in-technology allyship community and pulled other women close in the name of progress, ideas, innovation, literature, and financial independence. I helped enrich my students' digital libraries. I rose it to 4000+ students from PAN India, hosting workshops, offering academic assistance, organizing cozy celebrations for community members who didn’t have a family to return to during holidays, advocating for one another, helping my mentees secure offers from topmost international firms and negotiate salary jumps from $40,000 to upward of $120,000, standing up against our university’s unfair policies that allowed professors to bully students with impunity, and so much more. Furthermore, via the Ukrainian Achievement Fund organization, I helped displaced Ukrainian students adjust in their new country of refuge, new school, and get selected for top CS programs in the USA.You can find more details on my LinkedIn.<br><br>

And yes, I am a feminist. I advocate for women and I advocate with men. I'll soon prepare a polite FAQ on some disgraceful and some genuinely curious questions I get asked by my male counterparts so that we can avoid awkward conversations in future.<br><br>

If you need help with your career goals (near or long term), don't hesitate to write to me. I may take an extra nudge to reply back but once I do, I do justice to it. And if you can, buy me a vinyl record/vintage book/illustration/comic/canvas/bobble-heads/waffle/ceramic teapot/kahwa/sponsor my therapy session as a thankyou.<br><br>

Some of the interesting things I read recently that I recommend to you are Balaji Srinivasan’s The Network State, Asterisk Magazine publications, Taylor Swift’s tolerate it, Vice UK Media’s Empires of Dirt,  Paul Graham’s Superlinear Returns.<br><br>

My favorite question is “wait – why?” (NOT hinting towards Tim Urban) Most of the time I’m puzzled by things, I question them, some are unapologetic critiques, some are plain silly. But questioning them helps me separate the wheat from the chaff. I have opinions about (disliking) Van Gogh, big-tech industry, recruiting, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years" - a silent dream killer, dépaysement, bureaucracy, institutionalization, red-taping, tech ethics, education accessibility, unapologetic career jumps, how to not justify career gaps - Joey-style, academic tidying, AI Governance, the non-glamourous technology, historical blunders, intergenerational trauma, designing for gender-based violence, WWII, neo-colonialism, occupation, geopolitics, humanitarian crises, arms trade, prison complex, wokeism, rustic books, sassing patriarchy, irresistible political correctness, the Barbenheimer debate, BrooklynNineNine-over-Friends tribe, Taylor Swift (btw she's releasing THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT soon), cruel summers, ancient hair care and all things "Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica." I have documented some of my thoughts below. I will try to write more regularly in 2024.<br><br>
